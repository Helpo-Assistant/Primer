# Primer

Meet Primer, the light text-to-speech app you’ve always been searching for!
Type some text. Tap the Primer Button. And your device will start speaking like a real person; all thanks to Primer!
But why choosing Primer instead of the numerous other text-to-speech apps available? Here are some pretty significant reasons:

• It turns your typed text into real-time speech; even if offline. 

• Its size is less than 15kb; the 0.001% of the storage space that a typical photo would require.

• It’s personalised around you; your device’s wallpaper becomes Primer’s background automatically.

• It features an industry-leading, elegant UI that feels natural and enjoyable to use.

• Being completely open-source, it requires zero permissions and, of course, doesn’t contain any ads.
